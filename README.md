# ELMOPP
Edge Load Management through Pseudo-flow Prediction, or ELMOPP for short, is a novel algorithm used to increase traffic flow by considering future traffic flow through NLSTMs and assigning urgencies to different combinations of traffic lanes known as configurations to determine which configurations would result in the greatest combination of current and future traffic flow.

## Timeline
* 5/2020 - the idea behind the paper came to me when I was in a car and I thought about how one could implement a system of coordinated traffic lights that wouldn't result in so-called "red waves".
* 6/22/2020 - I finished learning multivariable calculus, linear algebra, and graph theory by this date and started work on my paper.
* 7/23/2020 - I finished the first version of my paper - I just need to proofread it and add more in-depth explanations.
* 7/27/2020 - I finished the first revision of my paper to submit to the *Applied Computing and Informatics* journal.
* 7/28/2020 - I finished the second revision of my paper after I was given tips and areas of focus around which to clarify parts of my paper.
* TBD - I submitted my paper to the Regeneron Science Talent Search
* TBD - I submitted my paper to the Arizona State University Sustainability Fair
* TBD - I submitted my paper to the Metro Richmond STEM Fair and the Virginia Junior Academy of Science
